# Mission Vista High School, Spotlight on Education Display

Built and programmed a digital showcase for my high school. Project showed videos of all classes available at MVHS and was created for a touch screen environment.

Videos are not available on this repo because they are several gigabytes large. I am working on finding a way to host the display online.
